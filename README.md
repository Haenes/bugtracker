# BugTracker
Initially, this repository was exclusively for the new asynchronous API written in FastAPI.\
Which was supposed to replace the old api written in [DRF](https://github.com/Haenes/bugtracker-old/tree/main/app/api).\
But then the idea came up to write frontend on a new technology stack (React + react-router + Tailwind CSS), which is based on this API.\
Thus, it's now a repository for a completely new BugTracker.

The main changes with the [old version](https://github.com/Haenes/bugtracker-old), apart from the technology stack, are as follows:
1) Asynchrony;
2) Improved API endpoint structure for clearer usage;
3) Authorization by JWT (for frontend) and Bearer Token (for API + [telegram-bot](https://github.com/Haenes/telegram-bot)).
